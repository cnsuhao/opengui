#####       OpenGUI 0.8 [Kunzite] Release Notes       #####

Version 0.8 [Kunzite] is a complete redesign of the
paradigms used in previous releases of OpenGUI. This
release, and those that will follow, are nothing like the
old code base. Many of the previously used concepts have
been thrown out and replaced with designs that are more
intuitive, provide better performance, and will provide a
stable API that can be used as the foundation of new
features, plugins, and tools for many years to come.

This version is a precursor release to version 1.0. It is
intended to allow developers to adopt OpenGUI before the
official 1.0 release, and as a side effect allow the
community at large to identify bugs so that they may be
fixed prior to the release of version 1.0. The API used in
this version is considered quite hardened, though
subsequent releases will make minor changes as the final
feature set is completed.

This release does not provide Linux support, though Linux
support is intended at the time version 1.0 is released.

___________________________________________________________
-- Known Issues
It is known that the current renderers do not honor the
usage of masks. Internally, OpenGUI recognizes the usage of
masks and should correctly form render operations that use
them.

-- Usage

During installation, if the precompiled SDK was installed,
it will have set up 4 environment variables that will point
to some convenient locations. These environment variables
are:
OPENGUI_HOME
OPENGUI_INCLUDE
OPENGUI_VC8
OPENGUI_VC71

Projects that use the precompiled SDK can use these
environment variables when creating their build
environments. Feedback and suggestions on these variables
is welcomed, and can be submitted on the OpenGUI forums.

-- Included Renderers

The Ogre renderer has been built against the Ogre 1.2.4 SDK
(Dagon). If you require integration with a different
version of Ogre, you may or may not be able to use the
precompiled renderer, though it is recommended that you
compile it from source to ensure binary compatibility.

The OpenGL renderer requires the use of GLFW, and is
intended for our internal use. It should act as an example
of how to write your own renderer, as well as possibly be
used as a template. The only tie to GLFW is currently the
retrieving of OpenGL extensions. A cursory examination and
some minor changes should be all that is required to
convert it for usage into any specific context.

___________________________________________________________
-- Porting

Due to the extensive changes that have occurred from the
previous 0.7.7 release, there is no simple conversion path.
The base widget class hierarchy has been completely
redesigned, and the incompatibilities are numerous. For
those of you that are using 0.7.7, I am truly sorry for
this dilemma. The old design is no longer being maintained,
but is still available from the SVN repository. There is a
tag for an unreleased 0.7.8 version that has been
beautified and had some very minor bug fixes applied to it.
If you intend on maintaining your own fork based on that
design, this is the tag that I recommend you use.
