\page Event_CursorLeave CursorLeave
This event signals the exit of the cursor into the widget's coverage area, as defined by its implementation of isInside().

This event is also augmented by the consumption of \ref Event_CursorMove "CursorMove" and \ref Event_CursorMoving "CursorMoving" by preceding widgets, which normally creates an environment where cursor entrance and exits are also representative of any clipping or visual overlapping amongst widgets.
