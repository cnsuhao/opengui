\page Event_Tick Tick
Tick events are issued to all widgets when time deltas are injected into the Screen via OpenGUI::Screen::injectTime(). These events bypass normal event propagation (much like the \ref Event_Tick "Draw event"), and are guaranteed delivery to all widgets within a Screen.
\par Introduced In:
	Widget
	- Widget::onTick
	- Widget::eventTick
	\par EventArgs:
	Tick_EventArgs
