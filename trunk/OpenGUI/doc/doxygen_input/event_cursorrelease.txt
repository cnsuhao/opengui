\page Event_CursorRelease CursorRelease
The primary cursor release event, signifying a release press within the coverage area of a widget as indicated by its isInside() function. This event only occurs if all of the following conditions are met.

- All parents have fully processed the \ref Event_CursorReleasing "CursorReleasing" event without consuming it
- No other widget has yet consumed the event
- The coordinates of the event are within the coverage area of the widget as defined by the widget's isInside() function. <small>(This restriction can be lifted by obtaining cursor focus)</small>

Consuming this event ends the propagation of the cursor release event, in which case peers will not receive \ref Event_CursorRelease "CursorRelease" or \ref Event_CursorReleasing "CursorReleasing". Most controls will want to consume this event, and this behavior is the default action within Control::onCursorRelease().
