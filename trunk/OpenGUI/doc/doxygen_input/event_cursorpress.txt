This event is common to both widgets and cursors, so both are explained here.

\section Event_CursorPress_Widget Widget
The primary cursor press event, signifying a cursor press within the coverage area of a widget as indicated by its isInside() function. The position coordinates in the event are always in Widget level coordinates. This event only occurs if all of the following conditions are met.

- All parents have fully processed the \ref Event_CursorPressing "CursorPressing" event without consuming it
- No other widget has yet consumed the event
- The coordinates of the event are within the coverage area of the widget as defined by the widget's isInside() function. <SMALL>(This restriction can be lifted by obtaining cursor focus.)</SMALL>

Consuming this event ends the propagation of the cursor press event, in which case peers will not receive \ref Event_CursorPress "CursorPress" or \ref Event_CursorPressing "CursorPressing". Most controls will want to consume this event, and this behavior is the default action within Control::onCursorPress().

\section Event_CursorPress_Cursor Cursor
Informs the the current visible cursor of a cursor press event. The position coordinates in the event are always in Screen level coordinates. While the cursor version of this event reuses the same Cursor_EventArgs, cursors cannot consume events. So whether you \c eat() the event or not makes no difference.
