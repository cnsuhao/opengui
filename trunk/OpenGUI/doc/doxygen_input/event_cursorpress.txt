\page Event_CursorPress CursorPress
The primary cursor press event, signifying a cursor press within the coverage area of a widget as indicated by its isInside() function. This event only occurs if all of the following conditions are met.

- All parents have fully processed the \ref Event_CursorPressing "CursorPressing" event without consuming it
- No other widget has yet consumed the event
- The coordinates of the event are within the coverage area of the widget as defined by the widget's isInside() function. <SMALL>(This restriction can be lifted by obtaining cursor focus.)</SMALL>

Consuming this event ends the propagation of the cursor press event, in which case peers will not receive \ref Event_CursorPress "CursorPress" or \ref Event_CursorPressing "CursorPressing". Most controls will want to consume this event, and this behavior is the default action within Control::onCursorPress().
