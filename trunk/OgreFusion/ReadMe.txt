    OgreFusion : Ogre Integration for OpenGUI
========================================================================

OgreFusion requires the Ogre library (http://www.ogre3d.org/). Since
Ogre is far too large and frequently updated, it is not included
directly into the OpenGUI source tree. The OgreFusion project settings
must be editted to point to your already built Ogre tree before it will
compile correctly. You will need to correct both the include search path
and the library path to point to the correct directory.

OgreFusion is loosely based on the OgreCEGUIRenderer project that comes
with the Ogre rendering engine.
