 * VC 7.1 (aka Visual Studio .NET 2003)
    Just open OpenGUI.sln in the root directory, select a
    build configuration and build the solution. All
    necessary dependencies will be automatically built.

 * VC 8 (aka Visual Studio 2005)
    Same as the VC 7.1 instructions, only use
    "OpenGUI VC8.sln" instead.

 * Code::Blocks/MinGW
    This requires STLPort, and is already set up to use
    the version that comes embedded with the OgreSDK.
    This build environment only partly works and isn't a
    high priority for me since VC8 Express is free. Fix it
    if you want, and send a patch.

See also: OgreFusion\README.txt for details on building
the OgreFusion project, which links OpenGUI into Ogre.

Linux
-----------------------------------------------------------
Linux isn't officially supported at this time, but here's
the basic rundown. You can expect this process to break, so
if you spend the time to fix it please submit a patch.

To build the OpenGUI library:
make debug -or- make release

To build the examples:
make examples-debug -or- make examples-release

I did my best to ensure that all dependancies will build
automatically. Your mileage may vary.

Other
-----------------------------------------------------------
You're pretty much on your own here. OpenGUI is written in
standard C++, and aims to avoid all compiler warnings. It
also comes with all necessary dependancies, so if you can
manage to get the dependancies to build, you shouldn't have
too much trouble getting OpenGUI to build. Any platform
specific #define statments can be found in
"OpenGUI_Platform.h". Patches that increase the number of
build targets are welcome, but stand a much better chance
of permanent inclusion if you also offer to provide
continued maintenance to ensure that the given build target
is always working in future releases of OpenGUI.
