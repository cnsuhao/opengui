-----------------------------------------------------------
Just open OpenGUI.sln in the root directory, select a
build configuration and build the solution. All necessary
dependancies will be automatically built.



Linux
-----------------------------------------------------------
To build the OpenGUI library:
make debug -or- make release

To build the examples:
make examples-debug -or- make examples-release

I did my best to ensure that all dependancies will build
automatically. Your mileage may vary.

You're pretty much on your own here. OpenGUI is written in
standard C++, and aims to avoid all compiler warnings. It
also comes with all necessary dependancies, so if you can
manage to get the dependancies to build, you shouldn't have
too much trouble getting OpenGUI to build. Any platform
specific #define statments can be found in
"OpenGUI_Platform.h". Patches that increase the number of
build targets are welcome, but stand a much better chance
of permanent inclusion if you also offer to provide
continued maintenance to ensure that the given build target
is always working in future releases of OpenGUI.
