Since OpenGUI is merely a GUI framework, it requires a real application
to perform the usual steps of creating an application window,
initializing OpenGL, and performing input capturing. The demo apps use
GLFW (http://glfw.sourceforge.net/) to fulfill the majority of this
requirement. GLFW is not required to use OpenGUI, the demo apps just
use it because it makes writing cross platform OpenGL applications much
easier.
