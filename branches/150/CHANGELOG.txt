Version 0.8 Release Candidate 1 - 11/28/2006)
* Complete library redesign. A LOT has changed, so read the documentation over again even if you've used previous releases.
* New Brush based widget drawing system.
* New Renderer implementation requirements. (Sorry guys, had to be done.)
* Removed Corona dependency from OpenGUI. No longer supports built in loading of textures. Renderers must now provide their own texture loading.
* All base widgets have been REMOVED from the core library. In their place are core classes that are designed to be inherited.
* Amethyst, the official widget set, has been started. It is far from complete. Your mileage will vary until it is officially completed.


Version 0.7.7 - 08/11/2006)
* Added alpha support for widgets
* Reworked logic behind vertical text alignment ALIGN_CENTER to now take individual glyph height into consideration instead of relying solely on the font's provided line advance.
* Fixed texture state problem in OgreFusion that would cause draw errors when an untextured renderop was drawn.
* Added PT_ENUM type to list of property types natively handled by the PropertySet system
* Extended <Property> tag parsing to allow 'value' to be contained within tag body as well as attribute
* New base widget type: OpenGUI/ScalingImage
* Added new Element methods: getNativePixelSize_Inner(), getNativePixelSize_Local(), and getNativePixelSize_World() 
* Added texel offset correction to OgreFusion to compensate for differences between D3D's and OpenGL's definition of a 'texel origin'.
* Added new demo to test/show off Ogre integration
* Corrected several memory manager conflicts within OgreFusion when using precompiled Ogre SDKs. (Sinbad, please consider turning MMGR off in public precompiled SDKs.)
* Updated OgreFusion builds to Ogre 1.2.2 precompiled SDKs (previous was Ogre 1.2.0 from source)
* Added VC 8 as a build platform.
* New installer based distribution for all Windows releases.
* Added project files for Code::Blocks/MinGW. (Only partly works and requires Ogre SDK to build.)
* Lots of documentation updates, XML system is now fully documented, as well as all base Widgets
