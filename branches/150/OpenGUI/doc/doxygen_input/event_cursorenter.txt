\page Event_CursorEnter CursorEnter
This event signals the entrance of the cursor into the widget's coverage area, as defined by its implementation of Widget::isInside().

This event is also augmented by the consumption of \ref Event_CursorMove "CursorMove" and \ref Event_CursorMoving "CursorMoving" by preceding widgets, which normally creates an environment where cursor entrance and exits are also representative of any clipping or visual overlapping amongst widgets.
