This directory contains tools that are used by the OpenGUI project. They are
NOT in any way affiliated with the OpenGUI project, nor are they subject to
the same licensing. These tools are all released under open source or
otherwise free (as in beer) licenses and are distributed with the SVN tree
ONLY. They are never packaged with the SDKs. If you are the owner of any one
of these tools and you would like your tool removed from the OpenGUI source
tree for any reason, please send an email to opengui@rightbracket.com and
provide your name and the name of the tool you would like removed. Upon
verification of ownership, the tool will be removed as soon as possible, and
a note to never include this tool in our SVN tree will be made in this file.
(And a replacement will undoubtedly be included instead. Gratz, you lost a
user.)

Only windows binary builds of these tools are currently included, as that is
the primary development environment for OpenGUI maintainers, and linux
installs are often more system invasive. (Sad but true.)
